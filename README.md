# croniot-watering-system

## What is this project useful for?
This project is useful for watering plants. It uses the [croniot](https://github.com/vladimir-ivanov-info/croniot-kmp) framework that allows to monitor the sensors (battery level and power consumption, solar panel energy, WiFi level) and run tasks (the watering itself).

You can configure how many seconds you want the water to be running for and at what time and minute that should happen.

There are 2 tasks: Water plants and LED Test. The second one is useful for testing whether the system works correctly.
